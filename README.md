# Redfour Golang

This is a repo were in we walk through the red four exercises. 

I use golang just to improve understanding of the code and concepts. This is not nessoary using funcational programing. 
We encountered ensues when we tried to achieve the same thing with erlang. So I am goiung to try with golang.
